## About me

Hi! I'm Marco Berta, an AI Engineer with 5+ years of experience designing and delivering AI/ML solutions across diverse industries and with a variety of partners. I help businesses and technical teams move beyond the noise of AI hype and focus on building systems that create real competitive advantage. Whether it’s an engineering team navigating rapid shifts in AI technology or a company unsure how to leverage it effectively—the challenge is the same: turning AI into practical, scalable impact before competitors do.

My background includes hands-on experience developing custom AI-driven systems for utilities, government, and e-commerce, as well as cross-industry collaborations. My tech stack spans Python, PostgreSQL, machine learning, FastAPI, OpenAI, Claude, Azure, vector databases, RAG implementations, and large language model integrations tailored for enterprise applications.
