## Customizing Your Portfolio

### 1. Basic Configuration

Edit `mkdocs.yml` to customize your site:

- Site name and metadata
- Navigation structure
- Color scheme and fonts
- Social links
- Extensions and plugins

### 2. Content Structure

```bash
docs/
├── index.md # Your homepage
├── about.md # About page
├── portfolio/ # Your work
├── blog/ # Blog posts
└── assets/ # Images and other files
```

## Deployment

I recommend publishing your site with GitHub Pages. If you want to keep your repo private, you need a GitHub Pro subscription. Public repos can be deployed with a free GitHub account.
 
1. Push your repository to GitHub
2. Follow the instructions here: [Publishing your site](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/)
3. Set up the GitHub actions for your project
4. Test the deployment by pushing changes

### Custom Domain

1. Add a `CNAME` file in your `docs` folder with your domain
2. Follow the [instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) to configure your domain and DNS settings
3. GitHub recently changed the DNS linking process: Let me know if we need to update these docs!
4. Also enable HTTPS on this page
